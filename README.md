imageAbstractor
==============

Weird litle project demonstrating the use of Composer packages by extracting the colors from an image and displaying the 1024 most used colors in a grid.

Requires [league/color-extractor](https://packagist.org/packages/league/color-extractor) and [monolog/monolog](https://packagist.org/packages/monolog/monolog).

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer install
```

## Caveat

Do not use. This project has zero value.
